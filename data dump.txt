DATA DUMP AND RECOVERY FROM SQLLITE TO MYSQL




This is what worked for me after a lot of trials. I was having a lot of trouble with groups and logs.

    While on sqllite, start server, go to admin and delete all groups. Then type the following in shell:

    python manage.py dumpdata --natural-foreign --natural-primary -e contenttypes -e auth.Permission -e admin.Logentry > datadump_3.json

    Change settings to MySQL in settings.py

    python manage.py loaddata datadump_3.json
